# Installing a Sump Basin

When we moved into our house, there was a 2ft deep hole in our front yard with the top half of a sump pump sticking out of it.  Clearly this was once a sump hole, but there was no sump basin, gravel, or any other siding to prevent the dirt from collapsing, so I’m not sure how it ever worked! Seems like the pump would have always just sucked up dirt! This year after redoing our front yard landscaping, I wanted to make this ugly hole in the yard both functional and more aesthetically pleasing.

First thing was to dig out the old pump. I thought this would be pretty quick, but I underestimated how tall the old pump was. It was buried super deep!

Next I dug even deeper. I used some post-hole diggers initially, though eventually I wasn’t able to spread the handles wide enough to grab anything so I ended up leaning my whole body down into the hole. I did this for as long as my arms could reach — almost 4ft deep. It was exhausting, but satisfying.

I picked up 4ft of 12” diameter black corrugated culvert pipe to form the sump basin. I had to drive across the bay to [Water Components and Building Supply](http://watercomponents.com) in San Rafael to source this. I used my MPCNC to machine a circular piece of HDPE cutting board into a bottom for the basin which I held in place with screws. I used a hole saw to cut a hole in the side so I could run a pipe from the driveway drain. I then drilled a bunch of 1/4” holes in the side of the pipe so that water could drain in from the sides.

I wrapped it in filter fabric, secured the top of the fabric with long zip ties, and shoved it down the hole. I filled in the sides with gravel and then dirt.

I then set about making a pretty top for it. One of my main motivators for this project was to make the hole in the front yard look better, so this part was important! I used the CNC to cut out a lid. I then used an [oil-based wood stain](https://www.amazon.com/Varathane-211724H-Premium-Stain-Mahogany/dp/B000BZZ46O) to stain it to a darker color. A day or so later I used [TotalBoat Clear Penetrating Epoxy Wood Sealer](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J36WRV2) to give it a waterproof seal. That epoxy took forever to cure (about a week until it wasn’t tacky). I suspect the wood stain I used interacted with the epoxy in a weird way. Also that epoxy is no joke. I mixed it in a Solo cup and it definitely melted that solo cup into a puck of hardened epoxy.

I waited until it actually rained, and I could see the sump basin fill up before I bought the pump. But sure enough last week (10/24/2021) we got a ton of rain and the basin filled up all the way to the drain pipe connected to the driveway drain.

To finish the job I got a [Zoeller Mighty Mate M53](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B000H5PYR2)  pump, some 1.5” ABS pipe and related fittings. I tested by filling the basin with a hose, but now I’m just waiting for the next big rain to see it in action!
